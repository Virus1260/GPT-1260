GPT-1260
This is a simple API server that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate text completions based on user input. It exposes a REST API endpoint that accepts a prompt string and returns a generated text completion based on that prompt.

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies: npm install
Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
arduino
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
Note: You can obtain an API key by signing up for OpenAI's GPT-3 beta program.
Start the server: npm start
Usage
