# GPT-1260

GPT-1260 is an AI model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like text. This repository contains a Node.js server that demonstrates how to integrate GPT-1260 into your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have Node.js installed on your local machine.
- You have an OpenAI API key.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key in the following format: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>`.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.

## Usage

To generate text using GPT-1260, send a POST request to the server with the following JSON body:

{
"prompt": "<your prompt>"
}



The server will respond with the generated text.

## Example

Here is an example of how to generate text using GPT-1260:

1. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/` with the following JSON body:

{
"prompt": "Once upon a time,"
}


2. The server will respond with the generated text:

{
"bot": "there was a magical kingdom where unicorns and dragons roamed free. The kingdom was ruled by a wise and just queen who was loved by all her subjects."
}
